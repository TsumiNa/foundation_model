# Generated Model Configurations

This directory is intended to store model configuration files (`.yaml`) that are:
1.  Generated by helper scripts (e.g., `samples/helper_tools/config_generator.py`).
2.  Used as base configurations for the CLI examples in `samples/cli_examples/`.

These configurations demonstrate how to structure model parameters for the `foundation_model` and can be used as starting points for new experiments.
